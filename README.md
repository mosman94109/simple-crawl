"""
Assume we're doing quite a bit of crawling around the internet to find content. This presents some challenges. This is a miniaturized version of this task to expose a few of those challenges.

We have a large number of inter-linked pages to crawl through, starting here:  

```
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/simple-crawl-4rBsUnE1wl/page_0.html
```

## This script does the following:

### \#1

Lists all crawled filenames.

### \#2

Lists all "dead links" -- filenames that were linked to but weren't there.

### \#3

List the three filenames with the highest number of incoming links and how many incoming links they have.
